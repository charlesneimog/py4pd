# py4pd 

<div>

py4pd allows the use of Python inside PureData. It has the same objective as py/pyext being much simpler to keep compile, mainly for Windows OS. It was, in first place, a trying to compile py/pyext for Windows OS, but I couldn't. Then I did the object. It is based in samples of code from Internet and how py-pyext works, mainly in the fork of SOPI research group.
