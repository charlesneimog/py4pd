# External Libraries

In this page I list all the libraries with `py4pd` that I know. This, someday, hopefully, will be something like OpenMusic Libraries section [OpenMusic Libraries](https://openmusic-project.github.io/libraries.html).


!!! tip "Check <code>py4pd</code> installation process [here](setup.md)."

I am updating `py4pd`, please wait for this section to be updated.
