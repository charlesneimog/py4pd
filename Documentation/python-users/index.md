# Introduction

If you use [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [PureData](https://puredata.info/), you can use the `pd` module, available with `py4pd` object, to:

- Use your own Python code as a PureData Object;
- Interact with PureData from Python;
- Make your Python Audio Research available in PureData and DAWs environment (using for example [PlugData](https://plugdata.org/));

In this section, I present what you can use with `pd` internal module. Below, are some interesting examples.
