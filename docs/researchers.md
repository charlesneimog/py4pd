# PureData Objects with Python 

With the `py4pd` it is possible to create new PureData objects using Python. For that, you need to declare your Python functions and then create a function called `py4pdLoadObjects`. See the Python Code:

!!! danger "Possible breaking changes"
	I am thinking about how to design this function yet. **It can bring breaking changes for now.**



``` py title="myNewPdObjects.py"

import pd


def mysumObject(a, b, c, d):
    return a + b + c + d


def py4pdLoadObjects():
    pd.addobject("mysumObject", "NORMAL", "myNewPdObjects", "mysumObject")

    # My License, Name and University, others information
    pd.print("", show_prefix=False)
    pd.print("GPL3 | by Charles K. Neimog", show_prefix=False)
    pd.print("University of SÃ£o Paulo", show_prefix=False)
    pd.print("", show_prefix=False)

```

In the code above, we are creating a new object called `mysymObject`. It is saved inside an script called `myNewPdObjects.py`. To load this script in PureData how need to follow these steps:

* Copy the script `myNewPdObjects.py` for the `resources/scripts` inside `py4pd` folder or put it on side of your PureData patch.
* Create a new `py4pd` with this config: `py4pd -library myNewPdObjects`.
* Add the new object, in this case `mysumObject`.

Following this steps we have this patch:

</p>

Note that we need to declare `py4pd -library` as is used in `declare` object, followed by the name of the script where the function `py4pdLoadObjects` is located. 

If you have some problem to do that, please report on [Github](https://github.com/charlesneimog/py4pd/discussions/categories/q-a). 

!!! note "Just normal objects"
	Note that, at least in version 0.6.1 we have no possibility to create `audio` and `vis` objects. I am 		working on that!
