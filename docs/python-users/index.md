# Introduction

If you use [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [PureData](https://puredata.info/), you can use the `pd` module, available with `py4pd` object, to:

- Use your own Python code as a PureData Objects;
- Interact with PureData from Python;
- Make your Python Audio Research Avaible in PureData and DAWs enviroment (using for example [PlugData](https://plugdata.org/));

In this section I present all things that you can do with `pd` internal module. Below, some interesting examples.
