Welcome to the `py4pd` documentation! I am writing this yet, and some things are incomplete.

`py4pd` allows the use of Python within PureData. It has the same goal as [py/pyext](https://github.com/grrrr/py), being simpler to keep up to date, use modules, use lists, and other things. With Python you can:

* Work with AI;
* Audio analisys;
* Use scores inside PureData;
* Use svg/draws as scores;
* OpenMusic functions in libraries like `om_py`, `music21`, `neoscore`, and others;

## Quick Examples

Here I will present some examples that I am using in my pieces.  

### Draws as scores

I will write the doc soon.

### Spectral analysis

I will write the doc soon.

### Eco (2023)

I will write the doc soon.
