Welcome to the **py4pd** documentation!

`py4pd` allows the use of Python within PureData. It has the same goal as [py/pyext](https://github.com/grrrr/py), being simpler to keep up to date, use modules, use lists, and other things.  with Python you can:

* Work with AI;
* Audio analisys;
* Use scores inside PureData;
* Use svg/draws as scores;
* OpenMusic functions in libraries like `om_py`, `music21`, `neoscore`, and others;
