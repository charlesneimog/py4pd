Welcome to the **py4pd** documentation!

`py4pd` allows the use of Python within PureData. It has the same goal as [py/pyext](https://github.com/grrrr/py), being simpler to keep up to date, use modules, use lists, and other things.  with Python you can:

* Use scores inside PureData;
* Use svg/draws as scores;
* OpenMusic functions in libraries like `om_py`, `music21`, `neoscore`, and others;

## How to Install

1. Open PureData, `Help->Find Externals->` search for `py4pd` then select py4pd and click on `Install`: 
2. ⚠️ For now, you must install Python ⚠️.
