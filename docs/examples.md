# Composition Examples

## Eco (2023)

Eco it is the first piece of one set of pieces composed by myself (I am Charles Neimog). It stolen some of the ideas of another Brazilian composer called Ricardo Thomasi, that develop a system of retro-alimentation. Eco has the same ideia, we use Web-Assembly to run a simple Partial Tracking in smartphones/tables of instrumentalist and, with `neoscore`, we generate realtime scores based in this Partial Tracking (that is heard the music played).  

(just a draft...)
